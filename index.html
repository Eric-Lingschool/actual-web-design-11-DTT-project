    <h1>League of Legends club</h1>
    <p>League of Legends club is on every Tuesday and Wednesday right after school in X2, running from 2:40 to 4:30pm.
        <br><br>
        Here you’ll have the opportunity to play the game with your friends on a decent computer that runs League with around 100 fps - perfect for those without a gaming setup at home. 
        It's also a great opportunity to make new friends or receive free coaching from the experienced members of the school's competitive esports teams.
        <br><br>
        Every year, Burnside competes within the official New Zealand League of Legends High School Championship and also the Christchurch City League Championship run by the City Council. In recent years, Burnside’s rosters have consistently placed amongst the best in the country.
        Win enough games and you may find yourself playing on stage in Auckland, fighting for the title of the best team in New Zealand. 
        <br><br>
        If you’ve got that competitive spirit, the drive to be the best, the need to prove to yourself - form a team with like-minded friends and come talk to Mr. Cresswell.
